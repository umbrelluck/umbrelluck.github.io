            The <strong>HTML <code>audio</code> element</strong> is used to embed sound content in documents. It may
            contain one or more audio sources,
            represented using the <code>src</code> attribute or the
            <code>source</code> element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination
            for
            streamed
            media,
            using a MediaStream.<br>

            <!-- <strong>Attributes</strong> -->
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>autoplay</strong><br>
                    A Boolean attribute: if specified, the audio will automatically begin playback as soon as it can do
                    so, without waiting
                    for the entire audio file to finish downloading.
                    Note: Sites that automatically play audio (or videos with an audio track) can be an unpleasant
                    experience for users, so
                    should be avoided when possible. If you must offer autoplay functionality, you should make it opt-in
                    (requiring a user
                    to specifically enable it). However, this can be useful when creating media elements whose source
                    will be set at a later
                    time, under user control. See our autoplay guide for additional information about how to properly
                    use autoplay.

                <li>
                    <strong>controls</strong><br>
                    If this attribute is present, the browser will offer controls to allow the user to control audio
                    playback,
                    including
                    volume, seeking, and pause/resume playback.

                <li>
                    <strong>crossorigin</strong><br>
                    This enumerated attribute indicates whether to use CORS to fetch the related audio file.
                    CORS-enabled
                    resources can be
                    reused in the <code>canvas</code> element without being tainted. The allowed values are: <br>
                    <strong>anonymous</strong><br>
                    Sends a cross-origin request without a credential. In other words, it sends the Origin: HTTP header
                    without a
                    cookie, X.509 certificate, or performing HTTP Basic authentication. If the server does not give
                    credentials to the
                    origin site (by not setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: HTTP header), the image will be
                    tainted,
                    and its usage
                    restricted.
                    <br><strong>use-credentials</strong><br>
                    Sends a cross-origin request with a credential. In other words, it sends the Origin: HTTP header
                    with a
                    cookie, a
                    certificate, or performing HTTP Basic authentication. If the server does not give credentials to the
                    origin site
                    (through Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: HTTP header), the image will be tainted and its usage
                    restricted.
                    When not present, the resource is fetched without a CORS request (i.e. without sending the Origin:
                    HTTP
                    header),
                    preventing its non-tainted used in <code>canvas</code> elements. If invalid, it is handled as if the
                    enumerated
                    keyword
                    anonymous was used. See CORS settings attributes for additional information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>currentTime</strong><br>
                    Reading currentTime returns a double-precision floating-point value indicating the current playback
                    position, in
                    seconds, of the audio. If the audio's metadata isn't available yet—thereby preventing you from
                    knowing the
                    media's start time or duration—currentTime instead indicates, and can be used to change, the time at
                    which
                    playback will begin. Otherwise, setting currentTime sets the current playback position to the given
                    time and
                    seeks the media to that position if the media is currently loaded.

                    If the audio is being streamed, it's possible that the user agent may not be able to obtain some
                    parts of the
                    resource if that data has expired from the media buffer. Other audio may have a media timeline that
                    doesn't
                    start at 0 seconds, so setting currentTime to a time before that would fail. For example, if the
                    audio's media
                    timeline starts at 12 hours, setting currentTime to 3600 would be an attempt to set the current
                    playback
                    position well before the beginning of the media, and would fail. The getStartDate() method can be
                    used to
                    determine the beginning point of the media timeline's reference frame.

                <li>
                    <strong>disableRemotePlayback</strong><br>
                    A Boolean attribute used to disable the capability of remote playback in devices that are attached
                    using wired
                    (HDMI, DVI, etc.) and wireless technologies (Miracast, Chromecast, DLNA, AirPlay, etc). See this
                    proposed
                    specification for more information.
                    In Safari, you can use x-webkit-airplay="deny" as a fallback.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>duration</strong> | Read only <br>
                    A double-precision floating-point value which indicates the duration (total length) of the audio in
                    seconds, on
                    the media's timeline. If no media is present on the element, or the media is not valid, the returned
                    value is
                    NaN. If the media has no known end (such as for live streams of unknown duration, web radio, media
                    incoming from
                    WebRTC, and so forth), this value is +Infinity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>loop</strong><br>
                    A Boolean attribute: if specified, the audio player will automatically seek back to the start upon
                    reaching the
                    end of the audio.
                    muted
                    A Boolean attribute that indicates whether the audio will be initially silenced. Its default value
                    is false.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>preload</strong><br>
                    This enumerated attribute is intended to provide a hint to the browser about what the author thinks
                    will lead to
                    the best user experience. It may have one of the following values:
                    none: Indicates that the audio should not be preloaded.
                    metadata: Indicates that only audio metadata (e.g. length) is fetched.
                    auto: Indicates that the whole audio file can be downloaded, even if the user is not expected to use
                    it.
